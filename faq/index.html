  <article>
    <p>My work email address is <a href="mailto:lreyzin@uic.edu">lreyzin@uic.edu</a>.<br /><br /> But please read the FAQ below before cold emailing me, as your question may already be answered below.</p>

<hr />

<p><b>Q</b>: <i>You have an appointment in MSCS, but what is MSCS?
Are you in a ‚Äúcombined‚Äù math and cs department?</i><br />
<b>A</b>:  <a href="http://mscs.uic.edu">MSCS</a> stands for ‚ÄúMathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science,‚Äù but it‚Äôs basically
a broad a math department that also includes some faculty in statistics and mathematical aspects of
computer science,
and we often just refer to it as ‚Äúmath.‚Äù
It‚Äôs also not really a combined department because there‚Äôs a full-fledged
<a href="http://cs.uic.edu">Computer Science</a> (CS) department in our engineering school, where I
also have a courtesy appointment.<br /></p>

<p><b>Q</b>: <i>Your site says that you are also in the mathematical computer science (MCS) group. What is MCS?</i><br />
<b>A</b>: <a href="http://mscs.uic.edu/~mcs">MCS</a> stands for ‚ÄúMathematical
Computer Science.‚Äù It is a <a href="http://math.uic.edu/~mcs/faculty.html">group</a>
within the math department. MCS faculty
work in theoretical computer science, combinatorics, and related topics.  Related to this, the department offers
a ‚ÄúMathematics and Computer Science‚Äù
<a href="https://mscs.uic.edu/undergraduate/majors/">B.S.</a> and a
Mathematics M.S. with a Mathematical Computer Science <a href="https://mscs.uic.edu/graduate/degree-programs/ms-computer-science/">concentration</a>.
MCS is also a ‚Äútrack‚Äù in MSCS‚Äôs Ph.D. program, though the Ph.D. degree itself
is in Mathematics.
It‚Äôs much more confusing than it needs to be.<br /></p>

<p><b>Q</b>: <i>I am a UIC graduate student. Do you have any TAships for me?</i><br />
<b>A</b>:
In math, individual professors generally don‚Äôt hire their own TAs ‚Äì the MSCS graduate
office is in charge of hiring our graduate TAs.  The department generally only hires its own graduate students,
but there have been exceptions.
If you‚Äôre interested in TAing MSCS classes, you‚Äôll have to check with <a href="https://mscs.uic.edu/graduate/gscontact/">them</a>.<br /></p>

<p><b>Q</b>: <i>I am a UIC graduate student. Can you hire me as your RA?</i><br />
<b>A</b>:
Funding for research assistantships is very limited, and even most doctoral
students in my department are funded through teaching assistantships.
When I do have funding to hire RAs, it is reserved for my advisees.
<br /></p>

<p><b>Q</b>:
<i>I am interested working with you as a postdoc. Will you consider my application to join your group?</i><br />
<b>A</b>: Unless I have an announcement on my site that I am looking for postdocs, or you
heard some other way that I am hiring, then no.
The MSCS department, however, does occasionally <a href="https://mscs.uic.edu/about/employment/">hire</a> postdoctoral RAPs (Research Assistant Professors),
and most of the department‚Äôs postdocs come via this route ‚Äì if you‚Äôre 
interested, I encourage you to apply.
In cases of strong graduating students significantly overlapping with me in research interests,
applying to the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5301">MSPRF</a>
is a possibility.<br /></p>

<p><b>Q</b>: <i>I want to be your graduate student.  Can I come work with you?</i><br />
<b>A</b>: If you are not already a student at UIC, you have to apply first. Our department accepts all students through an official <a href="https://mscs.uic.edu/graduate/admissions-and-financial-aid/how-to-apply/">application</a>
process, and applications are evaluated by a committee.  If you are a student in MSCS (or possibly CS),
then come talk to me, but I‚Äôll generally expect you to do well in a few 500-level MCS classes before I agree to
take you as a student.<br /></p>

<p><b>Q</b>: <i>I want to come to UIC for graduate school to study 
theoretical computer science (TCS).
Should I apply to MSCS, CS, or ECE?</i><br />
<b>A</b>: We have a lively <a href="https://cstheory.lab.uic.edu/">TCS</a> presence at UIC. Though it‚Äôs sometimes possible to work with theory 
faculty from a department other than the one you enroll in, if you
have an advisor in mind, I suggest
applying to the department where that person has a primary appointment.
So, if you want to work with me, you should apply to the MSCS department.
If you are not sure whom you want to work with, among other factors, you might consider whether
you want a Ph.D. in mathematics or in another field in making a decision
where to apply.<br /></p>

<p><b>Q</b>: <i>I want to come to UIC to be your graduate student.
Can you evaluate my chances of being admitted to
your Ph.D. (or Master‚Äôs) program?</i><br />
<b>A</b>: Unfortunately, no ‚Äì without having access to your entire application packet
(including the confidential letters),
I really don‚Äôt know what your chances are; they also depend on how many slots we have and
who else is applying.  Also, I get too many such requests to reply to all of them.<br /></p>

<p><b>Q</b>: <i>I am an undergraduate.  Can I do research with you?</i><br />
<b>A</b>: If you‚Äôre not a UIC undergraduate, then probably not.
If you are at UIC, then I‚Äôll generally expect you to have taken and done well in
MCS 401 and/or MCS 441 (or equivalent)
before mentoring your research.
Also, I generally can‚Äôt fund undergraduates, though if we find a project, there may be
<a href="https://las.uic.edu/lasresearch/student-research/lasuri/">funding</a>
you can apply for through the university.<br /></p>

<p><b>Q</b>: <i>I am a graduate student at another university. Can I
come work with you for a summer (or semester)?</i><br />
<b>A</b>: I normally don‚Äôt fund visiting students, but if you work on topics
that I‚Äôm interested in and have another source of funding, feel free to email me.<br /></p>

<p><b>Q</b>: <i>I am a local high school student. Can I come and do research with you to gain research
expereicne? I don‚Äôt need funding, and I‚Äôd be happy to help you any way.</i><br />
<b>A</b>: The research that I work on is theoretical, which means you usually need to know a lot
more than programming and calculus to start working with me ‚Äì this is beyond the experience of most
high school students.  I would consider working with a high school student
who has exceptional preparation (at least linear algebra, discrete math, and algorithms), but
in practice I end up turning down the vast majority of students, even those who are very bright and well-prepared.
<br /></p>

<p><b>Q</b>: <i>How is your last name pronounced?</i><br />
<b>A</b>: Though my last name likely stems from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose">thorny flower</a>, it is pronounced like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raisin">dried grape</a>.</p>
